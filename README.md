<h1 align="center" id="readme-top">Recipe App</h1>

<p align="center">This is a simple app. Click on a button and a random recipe will display!</p>

## Purpose

I decided to make this app for 3 main reasons:
<ol>
  <li>This is my first React project created using Vite. I have previously used Create React App for my projects, but as it seems Vite is preferred by many developers, I wanted to get some practice using it.</li>

  <li>I also wanted to get some more practice fetching data from an API.</li>

  <li>Finally, why is it so difficult to decide what to eat sometimes? Perhaps this app will provide some inspiration...</li>
</ol>
